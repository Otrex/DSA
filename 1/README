    Question:
-----------------
Given an array of integers, find all the "leaders" in the array. An element is considered a "leader" if all the elements to its right are greater than or equal to it. Write a function or algorithm to find and return all the leaders in the given array.

Example:
Input: [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Output: [17, 5, 2]

In this example, the elements 17, 5, and 2 are considered leaders because all the elements to their right are greater than or equal to them.
